			  <h1> About Me:</h1>
			<h5> Aspiring Data Scientist</h5>
			<p>
			I am currently pursuing a career in Data Science. I have a burning passion to discover the maths, the coding, and lifestyle related to this field. I'm always thinking about the next project to undertake, how to apply my learnings in math, and what sub-field to learn next in the world of Data Science. The vast majority of my knowledge is self-taught.
			</p>
			<p>
			As of now I am a senior at Northeastern University graduating in the Fall of 2020. I am a Business Administration Major with a concentration in Management Information Systems and a minor in Data Science. I came into college as a accounting major, but quickly realized my true passion resided in data. Ever since switching my path, I have felt much more confident and positive on the outlook of life. Everyday excites me because it's an oppurtunity to build on my foundation of data science.
			</p>
			<p>
			I am a intern at Fidelity Investments as a Data Analyst working in the Risk Management Department. This is my first "Data" role so far in my career. I greatly enjoy the people I work with and I am really truly grateful for Fidelity giving me a oppurtunity when no one else did.
			</p>

			Please feel free to contact me for career opurtunities, projects, or freelance work.
