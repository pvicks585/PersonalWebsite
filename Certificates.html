					<p class='about-p'> I am currently pursuing a career in Data Science. I have a burning passion to discover the maths, the coding, and lifestyle related to this field. </p>
					<P class='about-p'> As of now I am a senior at Northeastern University graduating in the fall of 2020. I am a Business Administration Major with a concentration in Management Information Systems with a minor in Data Science.

					<P class='about-p'> In my free time I often look to remain as busy as possible. I often have multiple data science projects going at once. Right now I am undertaking a project on NFL Data and when in a player's career do they peak. As well as projects, I've been taking many online classes on Coursera.
